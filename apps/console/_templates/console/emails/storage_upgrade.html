    <h2>More Storage and Exciting Changes</h2>

    <p>We have some exciting news to share with you! We have increased the amount of cloud storage included in
        BackupSheep plans, giving you even more space to back up your critical data at no extra cost. Our new cloud
        storage is powered by Google Cloud.</p>

    <p>Here's an overview of the new included storage limits for each plan:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developer: 5 GB</li>
        <li>Lite: 50 GB</li>
        <li>Startup: 100 GB</li>
        <li>Business: 500 GB</li>
        <li>Agency: 1000 GB</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are using your own storage then above limits doesn't apply.</p>
