More Storage and Exciting Changes

We have some exciting news to share with you! We have increased the amount of cloud storage included in BackupSheep plans, giving you even more space to back up your critical data at no extra cost. Our new cloud storage is powered by Google Cloud.

Here's an overview of the new storage limits for each plan:

Developer: 5 GB
Lite: 50 GB
Startup: 100 GB
Business: 500 GB
Agency: 1000 GB

If you are using your own storage then above limits doesn't apply.

We need your help to spread the word and reach even more businesses in need of our services. Get your unique referral link to share with your network, track your referrals, and monitor your rewards.
