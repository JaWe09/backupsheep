Whoops!

The backup of node {{ node_name }} ({{node_type}}) failed to upload to your {{storage_type}} storage {{storage_name}} at {{backup_time}}.

This error could be temporary, and we will keep retrying backup upload every 15 minutes for next 24 hours.

NEW! Starting 29th Jan 2023. If you select only your storage in backup schedule and the upload fails then we will automatically upload the backup to BackupSheep storage.

Error: {{error_details}}

If your storage is using any firewall then make sure BackupSheep server {{endpoint_location}} IPv4 {{endpoint_ip}} and IPv6 {{endpoint_ipv6}} is allowed. To view other endpoint IPs goto https://support.backupsheep.com/docs/backupsheep-ips
