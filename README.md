## Notice  
This is a complete rewrite of the BackupSheep application. I have started pushing code to the repository,  but it is not functional yet. Please follow the repository to stay updated.  
  
## Technology Stack  
Django, PostgreSQL, AlpineJS and TailwindCSS.   
  
## Background   
BackupSheep was a paid SaaS application from 2017 to 2023, serving over 6,500 users at its peak. Unfortunately, a poor decision to offer a lifetime deal (LTD) through AppSumo without proper due diligence led to a decline. 
As a result, BackupSheep was shut down in 2023. Rather than letting years of development go to waste, I have decided to open source BackupSheep.
